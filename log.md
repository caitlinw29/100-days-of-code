### Day 1: November 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I've completed Ania Kubow's Snake game tutorial on Scrimba (with the goal of using this base for a personalized Snake game called Ants Go Marching).

**Thoughts**: It's good to be back in the swing of things. Looking forward to seeing how far I get with this game before the [Game Off](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021) deadline.

3. [Ants Go Marching - Deployed](https://caitlinw29.github.io/AntsGoMarching/)

### Day 2: November 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I've added a good bit of styling into Ants Go Marching, and fixed a few issues (such as the food spawning where the ants were).

**Thoughts**: Definitely spent longer than I wanted to on the checkerboard pattern, but it was a good learning opportunity!

### Day 3: November 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I've added some small bits and bobs to the game, and got the ants to face the right direction.

**Thoughts**: The ants' directions were tricky! Probably could refactor that code.

### Day 4: December 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Submitted Ants Go Marching to the GitHubGameOff. Added owls, difficulty levels, and spruced things up a bit. Also completed multiple challenges such as Lighthouse Labs, Advent of Code, and 24 Days of JavaScriptmas!

**Thoughts**: Today felt really productive, I also tried and failed to do the first Dev Advent challenge. I had no idea how to find an emoji in an array, hence the failure. I'll try that one again later when I have extra time.

### Day 5: December 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed multiple challenges such as Lighthouse Labs, Advent of Code, and 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! Also was able to figure out day 2 of Dev Advent!

**Thoughts**: I still can't find that stinking reindeer in Day 1 Dev Advent...I'll get it eventually. Super proud that I got all of my tests to pass for Day 2!

### Day 6: December 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lighthouse Labs and 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! Tech Together Seattle Hackathon starts tonight - attended multiple sessions and met my team to decide on a hack!

**Thoughts**: Struggled with Dev Advent and Advent of Code, will have to try again later. Super excited to work on our prototype for the hackathon!

### Day 7: December 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lighthouse Labs and 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! Tech Together Seattle Hackathon: saw a few workshops and worked on my hack with my team! 

**Thoughts**: For our hack, we are submitting a Figma file rather than an actual app/website. This is new to me, but not unwelcome. It will be interesting to focus on the UI side rather than actual code.

### Day 9: December 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lighthouse Labs and 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! Started my bootcamp (round 2 as I deferred due to illness). Met with a fellow programmer-in-training to collaborate on a tutorial based project. Also nearly hit 70wpm on MonkeyType! 

**Thoughts**: Today was quite busy! I'm quite proud of my new highest typing speed, as I was a "hunt and peck" typer 5-6 months ago, with average touch typing speeds of 20-30wpm. I enjoyed meeting Ege to pair up on a project from Scrimba. I really want to take it a step further and customize our website (we are using the Scrimba tutorial to build it), rather than just following the tutorials.

### Day 10: December 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lighthouse Labs and 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! A day of bootcamp, completed the first mini-project (though I did most of it months ago). Completed 10 lessons of the Space Travel Website on Scrimba. 

**Thoughts**: Today was fairly productive! I also agreed to write a blog post for TechTogether about the Seattle hackathon, so that makes me feel both excited and nervous. The JavaScriptmas challenge confused me a bit as the pause seemed to stop the music, not pause it where it currently was in the music track. Will have to look into that some more.

### Day 11: December 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lighthouse Labs and 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! A day of bootcamp, focusing on Advanced CSS. Learned about Emmet through a Codepip game! Also worked on puzzle 8 for DevAdvent (not finished yet).

**Thoughts**: I got my booster shot today so I took it a bit easy. Loved learning about Emmet!! DevAdvent was tricky, but I did get 13 tests working and 13 is better than 0. I think my problem might be that I'm messing up a for each loop somewhere, I'm more familiar with for. I'll probably start from scratch with the for loop and see if my problem is the less familiar syntax.

### Day 12: December 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lighthouse Labs and 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! A day of bootcamp, focusing on Advanced CSS. Completed first homework for bootcamp. Completed CSS Review with codepip games. Attended a Twitter Talk "How to Stand Out as a JR Developer" on my lunch break.

**Thoughts**: Feeling very bleh today from the booster shot, so I didn't do much. Spent a few hours going over homework with peers from my bootcamp. The Twitter Talk was amazing to attend, I was super nervous at first because I'd never done one before and wasn't sure how it worked. I didn't get to stay too long, but the speakers were wonderful to listen to.

### Day 13: December 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lighthouse Labs and 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! Another day of bootcamp, focusing on Advanced CSS. Completed second mini-project and second homework (personal portfolio) for bootcamp. Made a quick guide to Emmet to share on Twitter.

**Thoughts**: Lighthouse labs was tricky today! Need to apply DRY principles and figure out how to make my code more flexible to take in values. Was considering keys. Really starting to get a firm grasp on trickier CSS in camp! Ege and I also decided that the space-travel site might be difficult to collaborate on, given the structure of the tutorials. We plan to complete the project individually and then work on a project from scratch together, instead.

### Day 14: December 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lighthouse Labs and 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! 

**Thoughts**: Lighthouse labs was super tough for me today! Lots of new syntax, etc. I'd never used for..in before! Saturdays are my rest day (during my bootcamp at least), so I'm completing my log early. I probably will code more today, but my goal is to knock out all of my "must-do dailies" before lunch and have the rest of the day free for activities of my choice.

### Day 15: December 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lighthouse Labs (final challenge today, so I completed all 21 days!) and 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! Reviewed Flexbox with Flexbox Froggy on codepip. Reviewed my notes for my bootcamp, and studied ahead for JS. Also got about 75% through Wes Bos's free Command Line course. 

**Thoughts**: Lighthouse labs was lots of fun, I'm proud that I completed all 21 tasks! I'm looking forward to starting JavaScript in my bootcamp. The command line course is mostly review, but has given me some cool tips for sure!

### Day 16: December 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! Reviewed Flexbox with Flexbox Froggy Pro on codepip, and Flexbox Zombies. Reviewed my notes for my bootcamp, and completed the rock-paper-scissors mini-project. Worked through all but the project section of the HTML fundamentals on Odin Project. Also watched the first half of Git and Github Crash Course by Google (on Youtube). Completed my blog post for TechTogether Seattle and submitted it for review. 

**Thoughts**: Today was full of fun practice! Writing the blog post was tricky, I'm more used to writing academically compared to writing less formally towards an audience of peers. It was great to review my Rock-Paper-Scissors repo and see how far I've come.

### Day 17: December 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! Reviewed Flexbox with Flexbox Froggy Pro on codepip, and Flexbox Zombies. Focused on JavaScript in my bootcamp today. 20 challenges completed on Edabit! Read Part 1 of Learning Web Design by Jennifer Niederst Robbins. 

**Thoughts**: Today was primarily spent on review of JavaScript, with practice of other concepts added in. I think I'm getting the hang of for loops, and even feel somewhat confident with targeting "this". For JavaScriptmas, I had no idea there was a cloneNode method!

### Day 18: December 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! 2 Problems on HackerRank, multiple on Edabit. Read part 2 (HTML) of Learning Web Design. Finished a pond in Flexbox Froggy. Focused on JS and APIs in bootcamp today. Completed the Random Password Generator homework.

**Thoughts**: I had a lot of fun on HackerRank, I had to remember that splice and slice are too different things though! Today was very busy with class, tutoring, and a Q&A session with our instructor.

### Day 19: December 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! Attended Scrimba's Twitter Space for non-technical coding interview questions during my lunch. Solved a problem on HackerRank, multiple on Edabit. Read intro to CTCI. Finished a pond in Flexbox Froggy. Also completed CSS Surgeon. Focused on APIs in bootcamp today. Spent about 5 hours in study sessions with my peers.

**Thoughts**: Super tired today, maxed out my social interaction. Feeling pretty confident in my bootcamp, which really makes me realize how much I have learned!

### Day 20: December 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! Solved a couple problems on HackerRank and Edabit. Finished a pond in Flexbox Froggy. My article was published for TechTogetherSeatlle. Focused on APIs in bootcamp today. Completed a pair programming session through Chingu. We are working on building a Lesser/Greater Guessing Game. Also spent some time on the word guessing game mini-project.

**Thoughts**: Still feeling nervous about the blog post, but I'm excited that I did it. Pair programming was unique. It takes some getting used to, having to adapt to other peoples' thought processes!

### Day 21: December 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Solved a couple problems on HackerRank and Edabit. Finished a pond in Flexbox Froggy. Spent some time on the word guessing game mini-project.

**Thoughts**: Took a day off yesterday (I plan on Saturdays being my regular rest day during this bootcamp, when I can manage it). Didn't do too much today since I had some non-coding related tasks to do. Tomorrow we review jQuery in camp, which will be great since I really don't remember/use jQuery.

### Day 22: December 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Solved a couple problems on HackerRank, codesignal, and Edabit. Finished a pond in Flexbox Froggy. Spent some time on the word guessing game mini-project. Reviewed jQuery in camp, as well as some bootstrap.

**Thoughts**: jQuery is still a bit weird to me. It doesn't look like you save that much space/lines of code, and it takes way longer to double-check my syntax is correct, so I prefer vanilla JS.

1. [Word Guessing Game](https://github.com/caitlinw29/word-guess-game)

### Day 23: December 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Solved a couple problems on Edabit. Spent time reviewing Bootstrap and jQuery UI. Finished the code quiz homework assignment. Read a chapter of Don't Make Me Think.

**Thoughts**: I also went over Tailwind but I'm not sure I'd call it progress as I was rather confused. I think I get the general idea of how to use it, but will need some practice.

1. [Code Quiz](https://github.com/caitlinw29/quiz-with-javascript)

### Day 24: December 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked with AJAX and fetch today. Started reviewing the Day Planner homework, I have some plans to improve the old version. Read a chapter of Don't Make Me Think.

**Thoughts**: I feel a lot more confident working with APIs now, compared to a few months ago. Still have lots to learn though!

**Link(s) to work**:
1. [Day Planner](https://github.com/caitlinw29/day-planner)

### Day 25: December 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked with fetch more today. Kept working on Day Planner. Read a chapter of Don't Make Me Think.

**Thoughts**: Taking a 2 day break from the challenge for Christmas, looking forward to project week in January after our break from Bootcamp.

### Day 26: December 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Went back to code quiz to refactor it a bit. Read a chapter of Don't Make Me Think about usability testing. Spent some time on the word guessing game to work on adding functionality to the buttons. Also spent time on Weather Dashboard!

**Thoughts**: My two day break turned into three days, but I still kept in a coding mindset with some coding books, podcasts, and chats. So I'm not going to restart at this time. If I end up taking any more breaks before my set break on Saturday, I'll restart then. Getting back into the swing of things and getting my feet wet with my projects and homeworks from bootcamp has been lots of fun.

3. [Weather Dashboard](https://github.com/caitlinw29/weather-dashboard)

### Day 27: December 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Read a chapter of Don't Make Me Think about user goodwill. Completed a few edabit challenges and some games on codepip (grid garden and the game about array methods in JS).

**Thoughts**: Being able to look at my old homework submissions and realize how much I'd change knowing what I know now has been eye-opening. You don't really notice how much you learn until you review old work sometimes. 

**Link(s) to work**:
1. [Weather Dashboard](https://github.com/caitlinw29/weather-dashboard)

### Day 28: December 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished Don't Make Me Think. Mostly spent time finishing the Weather Dashboard. Got the buttons working, as well as localStorage. 

**Thoughts**: Really happy with the "final" result of the dashboard. There's a few things I'd play around with in the future (such as removing a single entry with a delete button, which I'm not as confident with in localStorage since removeItem removes the whole key) but I'm proud of what I've finished.

1. [Weather Dashboard](https://github.com/caitlinw29/weather-dashboard)

### Day 29: December 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Read the intro chapters to Cracking the Coding Interview. Completed some Edabit challenges, and spent some time on Codepip playing Disarray and Code Crunchers. Updated my Weather Dashboard to include deletion buttons.

**Thoughts**: I'm even happier than yesterday, because I found a way to delete both the button and the saved city in localStorage when I click the deletion option. Rather than use localStorage methods, I spliced the cities array and then saved the new array to localStorage. I'm proud that I stuck with it and implemented a solution, though I did want to stop working on the Dashboard yesterday. I think it was worth the extra time.

**Link(s) to work**:
1. [Weather Dashboard](https://github.com/caitlinw29/weather-dashboard)

### Day 30: December 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Read the second chapter of Secrets of the JS Ninja. Updated my Weather Dashboard to include metric units and the ability to search in city, state format, after having some family try the app and give feedback. Started making some plans/wireframs for Virtual Zoo.

**Thoughts**: I'm extremely excited to start working on the Virtual Zoo project! I think it will be a lot of fun, and I'm going to use what I learned from Ants Go Marching back at the start of this challenge to make the map of the zoo.

### Day 31: January 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Disarray game on codepip. Created a baseFiles folder on my Desktop to quickly copy and paste into future activities (sets up html with links to css, js, jquery, bootstrap, fontawesome, etc). Completed the Simple Card module of the Figma to Code course on Scrimba. Continuing set-up for Virtual Zoo side project. 

**Thoughts**: I didn't realize that certain array methods existed, so playing the Disarray game was great! I'm slightly bashful to admit it took me this long to set up some kind of base file structure...normally I just used html boilerplate and filled in the links myself as needed. It will be much easier to just delete the links that I don't need for a certain project from the baseFile. It also saves some time of having to make my assets, css, js, img folders. It is all there ready to be copied and pasted! I'll get as much use out of it as I can before my bootcamp switches to working with backend and flips the file structure on it's head. 

I'm starting to feel a bit more confident with Figma! I'm still working on set-up/pseudo-code/wireframes for Virtual Zoo, but I'm going to take my time on set-up since it will be a fairly huge project compared to what I normally work on. I'm also super pumped to start our first project in boot camp this week!

### Day 32: January 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Studied node.js and got ready for the first project in bootcamp. Also spent some time drawing up some ideas for Virtual Zoo.

**Thoughts**: Today was not as productive (storms knocked out power and wifi, so it was hard to do as much in camp). Mostly spent time after class reviewing node.js.

### Day 33: January 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started the first bootcamp project, PlayMe. Completed a few edabit challenges. Updated my practice portfolio. Read ch.3 of Secrets of the JS Ninja.

**Thoughts**: Today my group focused on planning our project. I'm very excited to work on PlayMe, I am focusing on creating a card game using a card api. I have finished my first issue, and I have two more to go! I'm hopeful that I'll be able to set up more than one card game.

### Day 34: January 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Spent most of the day working on PlayMe. Read ch.1 of JS: The Good Parts.

**Thoughts**: I'm enjoying working on PlayMe, and have worked a fair bit of the way through my last (official) issue. I still need to add more of the War card game functionality, and make the game more mobile responsive. I've been helping my team with their issues as well, so I don't know if I'll have time to implement extra functionalities past the MVP but I'll definitely try.

### Day 35: January 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Spent day working on PlayMe. Set up the card functionality, still need to factor for event of War in the game, and also fix up some set-up issues.

**Thoughts**: Lots of work getting done today, although most of it was me helping my team so I've only gotten moderately farther with the card game. I'm doing my log early today because I know I'm going to be up a long time tonight knocking things out.

### Day 38: January 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Spent day working on PlayMe and reviewing Node.js. Managed to get search running to choose parameters of api call.

**Thoughts**: The project definitely has areas of improvement, but for 6 days of code, I think it's looking great! Especially since we had a MIA teammate and had to shuffle the tasks. One big scare was a mixed content error from one of the API fetch requests, but I figured out a meta tag to add and it fixed the issue. Excited to present tomorrow!

### Day 39: January 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Presented PlayMe today! Completed some edabit challenges. Working in node.js activities.

**Thoughts**: Presentation went well! Our team got the "Most Awe-Inspiring" award. Excited to launch into backend technologies tomorrow! Reviewing Node.js as that is what we start with in camp.

### Day 40: January 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Starting to truly understand node.js and ES6 compared to last cohort when I had a vague idea of what was happening. Attended Day 1 of #100Devs to supplement my learning.

**Thoughts**: Today was super productive! Got through all of the node.js activities, and am starting to review the README generator.

### Day 41: January 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Spent time on quote generator. Also finished the README generator homework. Read ch 2 of JS: The Good Parts. Completed a couple edabit challenges.

**Thoughts**: Got super stuck when trying to use an inquirer response to dynamically alter an API fetch request. I think async and await are what are tripping me up, will have to keep looking those up.
