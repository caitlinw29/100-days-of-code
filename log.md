# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I've completed Ania Kubow's Snake game tutorial on Scrimba (with the goal of using this base for a personalized Snake game called Ants Go Marching).

**Thoughts**: It's good to be back in the swing of things. Looking forward to seeing how far I get with this game before the [Game Off](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021) deadline.

3. [Ants Go Marching - Deployed](https://caitlinw29.github.io/AntsGoMarching/)

### Day 2: November 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I've added a good bit of styling into Ants Go Marching, and fixed a few issues (such as the food spawning where the ants were).

**Thoughts**: Definitely spent longer than I wanted to on the checkerboard pattern, but it was a good learning opportunity!

### Day 3: November 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I've added some small bits and bobs to the game, and got the ants to face the right direction.

**Thoughts**: The ants' directions were tricky! Probably could refactor that code.

### Day 4: December 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Submitted Ants Go Marching to the GitHubGameOff. Added owls, difficulty levels, and spruced things up a bit. Also completed multiple challenges such as Lighthouse Labs, Advent of Code, and 24 Days of JavaScriptmas!

**Thoughts**: Today felt really productive, I also tried and failed to do the first Dev Advent challenge. I had no idea how to find an emoji in an array, hence the failure. I'll try that one again later when I have extra time.

### Day 5: December 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed multiple challenges such as Lighthouse Labs, Advent of Code, and 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! Also was able to figure out day 2 of Dev Advent!

**Thoughts**: I still can't find that stinking reindeer in Day 1 Dev Advent...I'll get it eventually. Super proud that I got all of my tests to pass for Day 2!
