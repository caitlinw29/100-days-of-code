# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I've completed Ania Kubow's Snake game tutorial on Scrimba (with the goal of using this base for a personalized Snake game called Ants Go Marching).

**Thoughts**: It's good to be back in the swing of things. Looking forward to seeing how far I get with this game before the [Game Off](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021) deadline.
