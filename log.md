# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I've completed Ania Kubow's Snake game tutorial on Scrimba (with the goal of using this base for a personalized Snake game called Ants Go Marching).

**Thoughts**: It's good to be back in the swing of things. Looking forward to seeing how far I get with this game before the [Game Off](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021) deadline.

### Day 2: November 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I've added a good bit of styling into Ants Go Marching, and fixed a few issues (such as the food spawning where the ants were).

**Thoughts**: Definitely spent longer than I wanted to on the checkerboard pattern, but it was a good learning opportunity!

### Day 3: November 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I've added some small bits and bobs to the game, and got the ants to face the right direction.

**Thoughts**: The ants' directions were tricky! Probably could refactor that code.
