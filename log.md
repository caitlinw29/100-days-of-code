### Day 1: November 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I've completed Ania Kubow's Snake game tutorial on Scrimba (with the goal of using this base for a personalized Snake game called Ants Go Marching).

**Thoughts**: It's good to be back in the swing of things. Looking forward to seeing how far I get with this game before the [Game Off](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021) deadline.

### Day 2: November 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I've added a good bit of styling into Ants Go Marching, and fixed a few issues (such as the food spawning where the ants were).

**Thoughts**: Definitely spent longer than I wanted to on the checkerboard pattern, but it was a good learning opportunity!

### Day 3: November 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I've added some small bits and bobs to the game, and got the ants to face the right direction.

**Thoughts**: The ants' directions were tricky! Probably could refactor that code.

### Day 4: December 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Submitted Ants Go Marching to the GitHubGameOff. Added owls, difficulty levels, and spruced things up a bit. Also completed multiple challenges such as Lighthouse Labs, Advent of Code, and 24 Days of JavaScriptmas!

**Thoughts**: Today felt really productive, I also tried and failed to do the first Dev Advent challenge. I had no idea how to find an emoji in an array, hence the failure. I'll try that one again later when I have extra time.

### Day 5: December 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed multiple challenges such as Lighthouse Labs, Advent of Code, and 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! Also was able to figure out day 2 of Dev Advent!

**Thoughts**: I still can't find that stinking reindeer in Day 1 Dev Advent...I'll get it eventually. Super proud that I got all of my tests to pass for Day 2!

### Day 6: December 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lighthouse Labs and 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! Tech Together Seattle Hackathon starts tonight - attended multiple sessions and met my team to decide on a hack!

**Thoughts**: Struggled with Dev Advent and Advent of Code, will have to try again later. Super excited to work on our prototype for the hackathon!

### Day 7: December 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lighthouse Labs and 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! Tech Together Seattle Hackathon: saw a few workshops and worked on my hack with my team! 

**Thoughts**: For our hack, we are submitting a Figma file rather than an actual app/website. This is new to me, but not unwelcome. It will be interesting to focus on the UI side rather than actual code.

### Day 8: December 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lighthouse Labs and 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! Tech Together Seattle Hackathon hack has been submitted!

**Thoughts**: Happy to have completed my first Hackathon!

### Day 9: December 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lighthouse Labs and 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! Started my bootcamp (round 2 as I deferred due to illness). Met with a fellow programmer-in-training to collaborate on a tutorial based project. Also nearly hit 70wpm on MonkeyType! 

**Thoughts**: Today was quite busy! I'm quite proud of my new highest typing speed, as I was a "hunt and peck" typer 5-6 months ago, with average touch typing speeds of 20-30wpm. I enjoyed meeting Ege to pair up on a project from Scrimba. I really want to take it a step further and customize our website (we are using the Scrimba tutorial to build it), rather than just following the tutorials.

### Day 10: December 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lighthouse Labs and 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! A day of bootcamp, completed the first mini-project (though I did most of it months ago). Completed 10 lessons of the Space Travel Website on Scrimba. 

**Thoughts**: Today was fairly productive! I also agreed to write a blog post for TechTogether about the Seattle hackathon, so that makes me feel both excited and nervous. The JavaScriptmas challenge confused me a bit as the pause seemed to stop the music, not pause it where it currently was in the music track. Will have to look into that some more.

### Day 11: December 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lighthouse Labs and 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! A day of bootcamp, focusing on Advanced CSS. Learned about Emmet through a Codepip game! Also worked on puzzle 8 for DevAdvent (not finished yet).

**Thoughts**: I got my booster shot today so I took it a bit easy. Loved learning about Emmet!! DevAdvent was tricky, but I did get 13 tests working and 13 is better than 0. I think my problem might be that I'm messing up a for each loop somewhere, I'm more familiar with for. I'll probably start from scratch with the for loop and see if my problem is the less familiar syntax.

### Day 12: December 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lighthouse Labs and 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! A day of bootcamp, focusing on Advanced CSS. Completed first homework for bootcamp. Completed CSS Review with codepip games. Attended a Twitter Talk "How to Stand Out as a JR Developer" on my lunch break.

**Thoughts**: Feeling very bleh today from the booster shot, so I didn't do much. Spent a few hours going over homework with peers from my bootcamp. The Twitter Talk was amazing to attend, I was super nervous at first because I'd never done one before and wasn't sure how it worked. I didn't get to stay too long, but the speakers were wonderful to listen to.

### Day 13: December 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lighthouse Labs and 24 Days of JavaScriptmas! Another day of bootcamp, focusing on Advanced CSS. Completed second mini-project and second homework (personal portfolio) for bootcamp. Made a quick guide to Emmet to share on Twitter.

**Thoughts**: Lighthouse labs was tricky today! Need to apply DRY principles and figure out how to make my code more flexible to take in values. Was considering keys. Really starting to get a firm grasp on trickier CSS in camp! Ege and I also decided that the space-travel site might be difficult to collaborate on, given the structure of the tutorials. We plan to complete the project individually and then work on a project from scratch together, instead.
